# üìå File Timestamp Updater

üöÄ **Version:** 1.0.1

## üìñ Overview
This script updates file timestamps based on their filenames, using specific date-time formats. It is particularly useful for organizing files by their creation or modification dates.

---

## üõ† Installation and Setup
### üîπ 1. Install Python
Ensure Python is installed on your system. If not, download and install it from:
üîó [Python Official Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

After installation, verify by running:
```sh
python --version
```
or
```sh
python3 --version
```

### üîπ 2. Install Required Dependencies
This script relies on the `pywintypes` and `win32file` libraries, which are part of `pywin32`. Install them using:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
(Note: Ensure you have `requirements.txt` in the project directory with `pywin32` listed.)

### üîπ 3. Run the Script
Execute the script using:
```sh
python main.py
```

---

## üìù How It Works
### üìÇ 1. Select a Directory
- When the script runs, a file dialog will appear, allowing you to select a folder.
- It will process all files within the selected directory.

### üïí 2. Extract Timestamp from Filename
The script recognizes several date-time patterns in filenames:
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS` (e.g., `20250302_110320`)
- `YYYYMMDD_HHMM` (e.g., `20250302_1103`)
- `YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM_SS` (e.g., `2025_03_02_11_03_20`)
- `YYYY_MM_DD_HH_MM` (e.g., `2025_03_02_11_03`)

The `edit_date.py` module plays a key role in:
- **Accurate Pattern Matching:** Validating and extracting timestamps.
- **Error Logging:** Handling invalid or malformed filenames gracefully.
- **Edge Case Management:** Skipping files with incomplete timestamps.

### ‚è≥ 3. Update File Timestamps
- The script modifies the **last modified time** and **creation time** of each file based on the extracted timestamp.
- Logs for both successes and errors are saved in `Logs/success.log` and `Logs/error.log`.

---

## üîç Detailed Report
### **Changelog**
**Version 1.0.1 Updates:**
- Enhanced `edit_date.py` for better timestamp validation and logging.
- Added support for multilingual interface (English and Vietnamese).
- Improved logging format to include more context, such as file paths and error descriptions.
- Refactored code for better efficiency and modularity.
- Updated GUI responsiveness and user feedback.

### **File Structure**
- **`main.py`**: Entry point of the script.
- **`Modules/`**: Contains core logic.
  - `date_modifier.py`: Handles timestamp modification.
  - `edit_date.py`: Extracts and validates timestamps from filenames.
- **`lang/`**: Localization files.
  - `en.ini`: English strings.
  - `vi.ini`: Vietnamese strings.
- **`language.ini`**: Configuration file for selecting the language.

### **Known Limitations**
- Only supports filenames with specific timestamp patterns.
- Requires Python to be installed on the system.

## ‚úÖ Test Cases
### **Test Environment**
- OS: Windows 10
- Python Version: 3.10
- Dependencies: pywin32 (latest version)

### **Test Scenarios**
#### Test Case 1: Valid Timestamp in Filename
**Filename:** `photo_20250302_110320.jpg`  
**Expected Result:** Timestamps updated to 2025-03-02 11:03:20.  
**Actual Result:** ‚úÖ Success

#### Test Case 2: Invalid Timestamp in Filename
**Filename:** `photo_invalid.jpg`  
**Expected Result:** File skipped with an error logged.  
**Actual Result:** ‚úÖ Success, logged in `Logs/error.log`.

#### Test Case 3: Edge Case - Incomplete Timestamp
**Filename:** `photo_2025_03.jpg`  
**Expected Result:** File skipped due to invalid format.  
**Actual Result:** ‚úÖ Success, logged in `Logs/error.log`.

#### Test Case 4: Multilingual Interface
**Configuration:** Set `language.ini` to `vi`.  
**Expected Result:** Vietnamese UI strings displayed.  
**Actual Result:** ‚úÖ Success

#### Test Case 5: Directory with Mixed Files
**Directory Contents:**  
- `photo_20250302_110320.jpg` (valid)  
- `document_invalid.pdf` (invalid)  

**Expected Result:** Valid file processed; invalid file logged.  
**Actual Result:** ‚úÖ Success with detailed logs.

---

## üìú Logging
- **‚úÖ Success Log (`Logs/success.log`)**: Contains details of successfully processed files.
- **‚ùå Error Log (`Logs/error.log`)**: Records errors, including file paths and reasons for failure.

---

## üõ† Troubleshooting
### ‚ùì No Changes to Timestamps?
Ensure filenames contain valid date-time patterns. Files without valid patterns are skipped.

### ‚ùì ImportError: No module named 'pywintypes'
Run:
```sh
pip install pywin32
```

### ‚ùì Tkinter Not Found
If running on Linux and `tkinter` is missing, install it using:
```sh
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

---

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Support additional date formats.
- Add CLI options for non-GUI batch processing.
- Enhance cross-platform compatibility.
- Integrate with cloud storage solutions.
